# Binary-Tree

## Overview:
The binary tree is like a sorted list of values(node) the root node can have at most 2 children nodes. This tree is sorted that the left node is of smaller than the value of the parent node, the right node is greater than the value of the parent node.

## How Does It Work?
A binary search tree works when you have large amounts of values that you need to sort through. 
The tree works off of greeater than/ less than principals, where the parent node breaks off to less than or greater than values.
The Binary tree has advantages because it's array storage, you can access values and memory quickly with code.
To insert a value at the end of the list you just have to code with the length of the array, myArray[myArray.length]. You can find a 
specific index value by making an if else statement to compare nodes until yours is found.

## How Is This Data Structure useful?
There are multiple advantages to using the Binary Tree, it's mainly because of how these values are stored. If you wanted to access a specific 
index you would just take the starting index then add (index * element_size). A perfect example for using a Binary Tree could be an using number valuse
and sorting them in greater than, less than, relationship to eachother.
